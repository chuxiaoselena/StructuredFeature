http://sam.johnson.io/research/lsp.html

This dataset contains 2000 images of mostly sports people
gathered from Flickr. The images have been scaled such that the
most prominent person is roughly 150 pixels in length. The file
joints.mat contains 14 joint locations for each image along with
a binary value specifying joint visibility.

The ordering of the joints is as follows:

Right ankle
Right knee
Right hip
Left hip
Left knee
Left ankle
Right wrist
Right elbow
Right shoulder
Left shoulder
Left elbow
Left wrist
Neck
Head top

This archive contains two folders:
images - containing the original images
visualized - containing the images with poses visualized
